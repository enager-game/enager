# Scripts

Scripts in this directory are written with [Plumbum](https://plumbum.readthedocs.io/) using Python 3. Scripts are meant to be run with the working directory in `/enager/`, not in `/enager/package/`.

To run a script:

```console
pip install plumbum
python scripts/[script_name]

# OR
chmod +x scripts/[script_name]
scripts/[script_name]
```
